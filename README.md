- 👋 Hi, I’m @akiecodes.
- 👀 I’m interested in reading, exploring rabbit holes on the internet, and learning new skills.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning web development.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing presently as I consider myself a noob.
- I am averagely versed in Python, C++, MySql and have created a data driven model for a travel agency using Python and MySql.
